RELEASE NOTES (VERSION 1.0)
===========================

I include PSD, FLA and AI files.

There are 8 components in this set. Names are merely orientative. They are designed to snap into a square grid of “power of two” measurements (8, 16, 32, 64...) included in both their bitmap and vector versions. The purpose of this is to make them easy to arrange and encourage rough -yet precise- experimentation. Read further for more details on this.

As I said before, component’s names are merely orientative. I’m no engineer, and even if they feel more “achievable” than your average Star Wars spaceship, they’re still very much fictional. Feel free to rotate, invert, overlap and remix them until they look cool together. A cannon made of habitation modules and propellers? Sure! You only need your imagination to build your unique vessel in which to conquer the stars.

I include 3 spacecraft in order to show what’s possible. They are only examples, and I hope different people use the sets differently in order to achieve unique results. 

I’m currently working on second set with more components and I plan to do several. Engines, antennae, weapons, decorations, rust layers... are some of the ideas I’m playing with. The possibilities are vast.




WHAT'S THIS?
============

This is a vector, two-dimensional, grid-based modular set of spaceship parts. 
The idea behind it is to be an easy tool for anyone (not necessarily an artist) to explore, prototype and design visually plausible sci-fi spacecraft.

Set I is freely available for download, and a second set is in the works. 
I plan to make more in the future, and all of them will be free.




ABOUT THIS PROJECT
==================

Like many projects, it began as a personal one. While collecting references for a game project of mine, I became aware that the aesthetic I was looking for wasn’t really popular.
 
I didn’t want aeroynamics, space opera or fancy shapes. I wanted to take the present-day International Space Station, push it one or two centuries into the future and see what it looked like. Ships that (even if they weren’t realistic in a technical sense) at least looked realistic. So I started drawing them myself.

I hope you like it! Let me know what you use this for, leave your comments and suggestions in the box below or just drop me a line. Thanks for your time.
